Notes extracted from PDF (Buffer_Overflows.pdf):
- Avoid unsafe functions like gets(), strcpy(), strcat() without bounds checking.
- Prefer safer alternatives: fgets(), strncpy/strncat with careful null-termination, or C++ std::string.
- Always check argc/argv lengths before copying into fixed buffers.
- Allocate space for the null terminator (+1).
- Validate input lengths and use explicit bounds checks.
- When possible, use higher-level safe types (std::string) to avoid manual buffer management.
